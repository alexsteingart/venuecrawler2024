The slice in question is more square, thin, and crisp than most Sicilians, with the mozzarella next to the crust; the rich, thick, sweet tomato sauce on top of that; and a scatter of Parmesan on top.

The pizza is imperially thin, with a crust that almost crackles, and the quality of the tomato sauce and cheese keep pace. This is the kind of pizza where two slices is barely enough. At Joe & Pat’s you’ll never get bored — there’s a vodka sauce pie and a fried squid pizza, too, and other so-called gourmet toppings run to to scungilli, pancetta, and artichokes.
